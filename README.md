## Introduction
This repository contains a variety of Java programs that demonstrate different concepts, algorithms, and use cases. The programs range from simple beginner-friendly exercises to more complex solutions, offering examples for:
- Arrays
- Searching algorithms
- Sorting algorithms
- Recursion
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

## Programs
Below are some of the key programs currently available in the repository:

- **FindMin.java**: Program to find the minimum value in an array.
- **SearchIn2DArray.java**: Program to search for a target value in a 2D array and return its position.
- **SimpleLinearSearch.java**: Program to search for a target value in a 1D array and retrun its index.
- **EvenDigits.java**: Program to count the number of even digit numbers in a array.
- **MaxWealth.java**: Program to This is a simple Java program that calculates the maximum wealth of a customer based on their bank account balances across multiple banks. The program takes a 2D array where each row represents a customer's accounts in various banks, and each value in the row represents the balance in one of the customer's accounts.
- More programs are coming soon!
